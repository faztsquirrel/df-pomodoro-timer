# Distraction-Free Pomodoro Timer

Countless Pomodoro Timers exist, but all I wanted was a simple timer with no 
ads, no fancy animations and no online services. So I created this little
one-page website with the following features:

* Timing using the Pomodoro technique
* Text based timer, no animations
* Editable choice of task
* Log of completed Pomodoros
* Persistent changes, through local storage
* Works perfectly offline using caching
* Can be installed as WebApp on mobile devices
